Monitoring and logging of kubeless:

Prometheus:
Kubeless monitoring relies on Prometheus. The language runtimes are instrumented to automatically collect metrics for each function.Prometheus will scrape those metrics and display them in the default Prometheus dashboard.

Grafana:
You could also use Grafana to visualize the prometheus metrics exposed by Kubeless.
Example of a Grafana dashboard for Kubeless showing function call rate, function failure rate and execution duration:

Need to install grafana and prometheus.

Then create a datasource on prometheus to add in garafana.

Steps:

To install prometheus and grafana:

kubectl apply -f eks-monitoring.yaml
kubectl apply -f crds.yaml

To check the load balancer running for Prometheus and Grafana:
