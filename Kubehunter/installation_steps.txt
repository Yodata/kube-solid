kube-hunter hunts for security weaknesses in Kubernetes clusters. The tool was developed to increase awareness and visibility for security issues in Kubernetes environments. You should NOT run kube-hunter on a Kubernetes cluster that you don't own! 
Run kube-hunter: kube-hunter is available as a container (aquasec/kube-hunter), and we also offer a web site at kube-hunter.aquasec.com where you can register online to receive a token allowing you to see and share the results online. You can also run the Python code yourself as described below.
Explore vulnerabilities: The kube-hunter knowledge base includes articles about discoverable vulnerabilities and issues. When kube-hunter reports an issue, it will show its VID (Vulnerability ID) so you can look it up in the KB at https://aquasecurity.github.io/kube-hunter/
 
Deployment
The example job.yaml file defines a Job that will run kube-hunter in a pod, using default Kubernetes pod access settings. (You may wish to modify this definition, for example to run as a non-root user, or to run in a different namespace.)


Step1: Run the job with kubectl create -f kube-hunter.yaml
Step2: Find the pod name with kubectl describe job kube-hunter
Step3: View the test results with kubectl logs <pod name>
